/**
 * Web-native slash commands (prompt-composing).
 *
 * omp's own `/goal`, `/plan`, `/vibe`, ... are TUI-only builtins (`handleTui`);
 * the RPC prompt path (which omp-web uses) forwards them as literal user text
 * instead of executing them. These client-side commands fill that gap: the
 * palette advertises them and the client built-in dispatcher expands them into
 * effective prompts sent through the normal prompt pipeline, so the agent
 * actually receives a clear instruction rather than a stray "/goal ..." line.
 *
 * Pure definitions — no I/O. Prompt text is deliberately concise; the args are
 * user-supplied and embedded verbatim.
